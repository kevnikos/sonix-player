// Podcast Index, the catalogue behind the Podcasts section.
//
// Why this and not the RSS feeds directly: a podcast is an RSS feed, and in
// theory downloading it would be enough. In practice it is not, for two
// reasons:
//
//   * search. Without a catalogue, the only way to find a podcast is to know
//     its URL by heart and type it on an on-screen keyboard. Nobody does that.
//   * the format. Podcast RSS is XML with four namespaces on it (itunes:,
//     podcast:, media:, content:), and the wild contains everything -- feeds
//     with broken XML, dates in five formats, duplicated tags. This tree has no
//     XML parser, and writing one that survives the real world is a far bigger
//     job than it looks.
//
// Podcast Index does both jobs: it searches, and it returns already normalized
// JSON, for which a parser is already here. It is also an open catalogue with
// no advertising, which in 2026 is not a given.
//
// The signature: every request carries three headers -- the key, the time, and
// the SHA-1 of key+secret+time in hex. The time must be the real one to within
// a few minutes, and this device loses the clock at every power-off and gets it
// back from NTP at boot, so without network the time is wrong and the catalogue
// answers 401. See podcast_last_error(), which recognizes that case and says so
// plainly instead of leaving "401".
//
// Everything in here blocks. Call only from the page's worker thread, never
// from the UI thread.
