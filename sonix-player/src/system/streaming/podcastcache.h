// Podcast episodes downloaded to the card and then played like any other file.
//
// The third twin of qobuzcache.h and tidalcache.h, and the reasons for
// downloading instead of decoding on the fly are the same: decoder_open() wants
// a path, seeking inside an episode requires going backwards, and with the file
// on disk the queue, the equalizer, ReplayGain and the progress bar work with
// no extra code. See qobuzcache.h for the full reasoning.
//
// What differs from the other two:
//
// Little, which is good news: an episode has a direct URL and only needs
// downloading. No per-track signature as on Qobuz, no segments to reassemble as
// on Tidal. The differences are elsewhere:
//
//   * an episode lasts an hour, not three minutes. The cache ceiling is higher
//     accordingly, and pruning by last listen matters more: three episodes fill
//     what on Qobuz would be an album;
//   * the sidecar keeps the podcast id instead of the album id. That is what
//     makes "Show podcast" work in the track menu.
//
// Separate directory, as for the other two and for the same reason: the three
// catalogues number independently, so in a single directory episode 12345678
// and Tidal track 12345678 would collide on one file. Distinct directories make
// that impossible by construction and give *_owns() a clean answer, which is
// how the player knows which badge to draw.

// How large the cache may grow before the oldest episodes are dropped. Two GB
// rather than the other two caches' one: a 128 kbps episode runs an hour and
// weighs about 60 MB, so one GB is roughly fifteen episodes, too few for anyone
// following four or five podcasts.
//
// `LL` and not `L`. Two GB is 2,147,483,648, one more than the maximum of a
// signed 32-bit `long`, which is what this device has. Written
// `2048L * 1024L * 1024L` the compiler evaluates in `long` and the result wraps
// to -2,147,483,648, a negative ceiling that pruning can never satisfy, so
// every download empties the whole directory. A 64-bit host does not show it.
//
// Every byte count in this cache is therefore 64-bit: two GB does not fit in a
// `long` here, not even as a sum.
