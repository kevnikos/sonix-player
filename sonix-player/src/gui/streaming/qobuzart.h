// Cover art for the streaming-service lists.
//
// coverloader.c is not enough: it loads the image of a file already on the
// card, while a Qobuz cover is a URL that has to be downloaded first. This is
// the missing link: a thread that downloads and decodes, with coverloader's
// slot shape -- a list has a fixed number of rows, each row is a slot, and
// asking a slot for something new abandons what it was waiting for, which is
// exactly what scrolling does.
//
// Downloaded images stay on the card in `.local/qobuz-art`, named by the MD5 of
// the URL, so looking at the same list a second time downloads nothing. That
// directory is not cleared along with the cached tracks -- it is tens of
// kilobytes in total, and refetching every time would waste far more than the
// space it occupies.
//
// Tidal uses this too, despite the filename: nothing in here knows about Qobuz.
// A URL goes in, an image comes out, and the name it is stored under is the MD5
// of that URL, so two services cannot collide even deliberately.

// How many list rows may have a cover in flight: the rows that fit on screen,
// plus margin for scrolling.

// asks for a cover becomes the owner and whatever the other page was waiting
// for is dropped; the other page's take call answers "finished", which is what
// it needs to stop asking.
//
// `owner` is any pointer as long as it is stable and differs between the two
// pages -- the address of a static variable does. Without it each page would
// cancel the other's covers and draw them onto the other's rows.
