// Podcasts, up front.
//
// The same shape as the Qobuz and Tidal pages, deliberately: opening all three
// must not mean learning three interfaces. The same ground rule therefore
// holds -- everything that talks to the network BLOCKS, so it cannot run on the
// GUI thread: one worker, one slot for the job to do, and results handed back
// with gui_post().
//
// Three things differ here, and every odd choice follows from them:
//
//   * there is no sign-in. Podcast Index is an open catalogue: search and read,
//     that is all. No login page, no token to renew, and "my podcasts" is a
//     list kept on the card (podcastsubs.h) rather than something living on the
//     service;
//   * nothing is fetched ahead. Qobuz and Tidal download the NEXT track while
//     the current one plays, because a track is five megabytes. An episode is
//     sixty and runs an hour: fetching ahead would fill the card with material
//     that may never be heard. What is needed is fetched when it is needed;
//   * episodes come in reverse order. The catalogue lists newest first, which
//     is the order to see them in but not the order to hear them in, so the
//     queue built from a tap holds the chosen episode and the ones AFTER it in
//     the list, that is, going back in time.
